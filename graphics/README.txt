Place your plant animation sprite sheets or images in this folder.

You'll need to create a "plant_placeholder.png" file or update the Main.tscn
file to point to your actual plant animation image.

For animated plants, you can:
1. Use sprite sheets for frame-by-frame animation
2. Create additional Animation resources in the AnimationPlayer node
3. Replace the AnimationPlayer with a AnimatedSprite node if using sprite sheets
